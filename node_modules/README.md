# Express Boilerplate!

This is a boilerplate project used for starting new projects.

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start up a new project (NEW_PROJECT)

1. Clone this repo to your local machine 'git clone <https://github.com/coggins/express-boilerplate/> NEW_PROJECT'
2. 'cd' into the cloned repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for the project with 'rm -rf .git && git init'
4. Install node dependencies 'npm install'
5. Move the example Environment file to '.env' that will be used by the express server and ignored by git 'mv example.env .env'
6. Edit the contents of the 'package.json' to use the 'NEW_PROJECT' name instead of 'name: 'boilerplate''

## Scripts

Start the application 'npm start'

Start nodemon for the application 'npm run dev'

Run the tests 'npm test'

Run debugger (ndb) 'npm run debug'

## Deploying

When your new project is ready add a new Heroku application with 'heroku create'. This will make a new git remote 'heroku' and from there you can 'npm run deploy' to push this to the remote's master branch.
